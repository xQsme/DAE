+1 crit outfit (this affects your crystal set up) 
1 atk/cast speed from 4 piece boss gear 
Weapon: 2x BMC precision (8 all accuracy 10% to ignore 
Off-hand: Either Critical damage or awakened spirit crystals (150 hp 5 ap) 
Gloves: 1x BMC Viper (8 all accuracy 1 atk/cast speed) 1x valor (2 crit) 
Chest: 2x Evasion (10% special attack evasion) 
Helm: 2x 20 all evasion 
Shoes: 1x swiftness (2 movement speed) 1x BMC Hystria ( 1 movement speed 20 weight 150 stamina) 
This set up will bring you to 5 cast speed, 3 crit, and 3 movement speed. 
Lucky for us there is a food called margoria seafood that gives 2 crit, 2 movement speed, 100 hp, 50 weight, and lasts 90 mins. 
Bringing us to 5 crit 5 cast speed 5 movement speed. 
Obviously this set up is dependent on having the +1 crit outfit and 4 piece boss gear so you can see how you'll have to modify it if you don't have these things.
